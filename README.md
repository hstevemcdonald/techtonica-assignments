To practice using git...again
I am currently practicing making changes to my repo in GitHub. I have already practiced using the command line and managed to unintentionally delete a local directory, and with help brought it back into existence.

Also, here is something I learned about Markdown:
**bold**
__bold__
*italic*
_italic_
##h2 tag
######h6 tag
* list item
* another list item
  * sublist item
  * another sublist item
